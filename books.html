                                        This book will teach you everything you need to know to build your first Flutter
                                        app.
                                        You will learn about the basics of Flutter, such as widgets, state management,
                                        and navigation.
                                        You will also learn how to build a variety of different app types, such as
                                        games, social
                                        media apps, and e-commerce apps.
                                        By the end of this book, you will be able to build beautiful, high-performance
                                        apps using Flutter.
                                        Many books or resources be useful for learning Flutter, but in this book,
                                        I collect the most important topics you need to know and practice to master
                                        the app development process from the definitions of Flutter to the building
                                        of high-performance apps. We have divided the book into three sections, each
                                        section
                                        containing several chapters.
                                        The first section is prepared for development, which includes getting to know
                                        the
                                        Flutter development environment and running the first application.
                                        The second section covers delving into development and includes chapters on
                                        responsive
                                        and interactive design,
                                        null-safe programming, state management, keys, navigation, and database options.
                                        The last section is the completion of the development process, which includes
                                        performance tests
                                        and various types of building applications.
                                        Each chapter is self-contained and linked to other chapters.
                                        In other words, you can jump directly to the chapter you want,
                                        and you can adhere to the structure and sequence of the book, which is
                                        desirable.
                                        We've included many programming examples and practical applications,
                                        accompanied by figures and images illustrated from within the development
                                        environment
                                        and results associated with each process for further clarity.
                                        After each chapter, we have included accompanying questions to increase
                                        understanding
                                        and comprehension.
                                        We are all confident that this work will be your first step into the world of
                                        building
                                        and developing Flutter applications.

                                        Flutter is a cross-platform apps or games development framework created by
                                        Google. It allows you to build native apps for Android and iOS using the same
                                        codebase. Flutter is known for its high performance, beautiful UI, and ease of
                                        use. This book will teach you everything you need to know to build your first
                                        Flutter app. You will learn about the basics of Flutter, such as widgets, state
                                        management, and navigation. You will also learn how to build a variety of
                                        different app types, such as games, social media apps, and e-commerce apps. By
                                        the end of this book, you will be able to build beautiful, high-performance apps
                                        or games using Flutter.
                                        Here are some of the benefits of using Flutter:
                                        • High performance: Flutter apps are known for their high performance. They are
                                        as fast as native apps and can even outperform them in some cases.
                                        • Beautiful UI: Flutter apps are known for their beautiful UI. Flutter uses a
                                        declarative UI approach, which makes it easy to create complex UIs that are both
                                        visually appealing and functional.
                                        • Ease of use: Flutter is a very easy framework to use. It has a simple syntax
                                        and a well-documented API. This makes it easy to get started with Flutter, even
                                        if you are new to apps or game development. If you are looking for a
                                        cross-platform apps or games development framework that is high-performance,
                                        beautiful, and easy to use, then Flutter is the perfect choice for you.
                                        Many books or resources be useful for learning Flutter, but in this book, I
                                        collect the most important topics you need to know and practice to master the
                                        app development process from the definitions of Flutter to the building of
                                        high-performance apps. We have divided the book into three sections, each
                                        section containing several chapters. The first section is prepared for
                                        development, which includes getting to know the Flutter development environment
                                        and running the first application. The second section covers delving into
                                        development and includes chapters on responsive and interactive design,
                                        null-safe programming, state management, keys, navigation, and database options.
                                        The last section is the completion of the development process, which includes
                                        performance tests and various types of building applications. Each chapter is
                                        self-contained and linked to other chapters. In other words, you can jump
                                        directly to the chapter you want, and you can adhere to the structure and
                                        sequence of the book, which is desirable. We've included many programming
                                        examples and practical applications, accompanied by figures and images
                                        illustrated from within the development environment and results associated with
                                        each process for further clarity. After each chapter, we have included
                                        accompanying questions to increase understanding and comprehension. We are all
                                        confident that this work will be your first step into the world of building and
                                        developing Flutter applications.
